# My first binder
My first Binder wohoo! [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andreabecsek/my-first-binder/HEAD)

Note:
* by default binder will open jupyter notebook
* you can change this by adding *?urlpath=lab* to the end of you link for **Jupyter Lab** and *?urlpath=rstudio* for **RStudio**
* finally your link should look something like this https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your-username/my-first-binder/HEAD?urlpath=lab
